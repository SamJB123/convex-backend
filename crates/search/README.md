# Search Crate

The `search` crate handles search-related functionality within the Convex backend. It provides various modules and components to support search operations, including text indexing, query processing, and search result scoring.

## Purpose and Functionality

The primary purpose of the `search` crate is to enable efficient and scalable search capabilities within the Convex backend. It provides the necessary infrastructure to index and query data, allowing users to perform search operations on their data stored in Convex.

## Main Modules and Components

The `search` crate consists of several main modules and components, each responsible for different aspects of search functionality:

- `aggregation`: Handles aggregation operations for search results.
- `constants`: Defines various constants used in the search crate.
- `convex_query`: Provides query processing functionality for Convex-specific queries.
- `disk_index`: Manages disk-based indexing for search data.
- `fragmented_segment`: Handles fragmented segments in the search index.
- `incremental_index`: Supports incremental indexing of search data.
- `intersection`: Handles intersection operations for search queries.
- `levenshtein_dfa`: Implements Levenshtein automata for approximate string matching.
- `metrics`: Provides metrics and logging for search operations.
- `query`: Handles query parsing and execution.
- `scoring`: Implements scoring algorithms for search results.
- `tantivy_query`: Integrates with the Tantivy search engine for query execution.
- `text_index_manager`: Manages text indexing operations.
